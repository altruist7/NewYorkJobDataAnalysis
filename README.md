# NewYorkJobDataAnalysis

### 1.	Business Context 
Using the given data set for New York City Current Job Posting data.   
 
### 2.	Business Problem Understanding
Focus on applying the learnt data analytics concepts and try to share your findings on following aspects:    
* a)	What are the highest paid Skills in the US market?  
* b)	What are the job categories, which involve above mentioned niche skills?  
* c)	Applying clustering concepts, please depict visually what are the different salary ranges based on job category and years of experience.  

### 3.	Expected Outcomes 
The results should consists of   
* a)	The python script file or Jupyter notebook containing all the code for the proposed solution. Write all code in single file only, with proper comments. Don’t include data file in the zipped file.   
* b)	A word document file containing answer to the following three sub questions (as asked above ) based on the analysis that you have carried out earlier.
