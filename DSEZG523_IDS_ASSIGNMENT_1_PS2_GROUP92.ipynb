      " 'The New York City Board of Correction (BOC) is a nine-person, non-judicial oversight board, which regulates, monitors, and inspects the correctional facilities of the City. Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the BoardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s five functions:  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tEstablish and ensure compliance with minimum standards Ã¢â‚¬Å“for the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the jurisdiction of the Department of CorrectionÃ¢â‚¬Â\\x9d Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tInvestigate serious incidents Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tReview grievances from people in custody and staff Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tEvaluate the performance of the Department of Correction Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tMake recommendations on areas of key correctional planning  The Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules codifying ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21 year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. The Board also recently enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jails. Going forward, BOC will conduct rulemaking on restrictive housing and update its Mental Health Minimum Standards.  Over the past two years, in an effort to expand its research, monitoring and rule-making efforts, the Board has nearly doubled its annual budget (currently $3 million) and its staff (currently 29, with planned expansion to 35). With offices in lower Manhattan and Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with the Department of Correction (Ã¢â‚¬Å“DOCÃ¢â‚¬Â\\x9d) and NYC Health + Hospitals (Ã¢â‚¬Å“H+HÃ¢â‚¬Â\\x9d), and often with other government and external partners, on a wide variety of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities. The Board brings to this work a strong emphasis on data-sharing, data-driven decision making and public reporting. In keeping with major reforms occurring at the national, state and local level, the Board recently re-envisioned its mission: to carry out independent oversight and enact regulation in support of safer, fairer, smaller and more humane jails.'\n",

      " 'The New York City Board of Correction (BOC) is a nine-person, non-judicial oversight board, which regulates, monitors, and inspects the correctional facilities of the City. Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the BoardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s five functions: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tEstablish and ensure compliance with minimum standards for the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tInvestigate serious incidents; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tReview grievances from people in custody and staff; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tEvaluate the performance of the Department of Correction; and, Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tMake recommendations on areas of key correctional planning. The Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules codifying ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. The Board also recently enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jails. Going forward, BOC will conduct rulemaking on restrictive housing and update its Mental Health Minimum Standards. Over the past two years, in an effort to expand its research, monitoring and rule-making efforts, the Board has nearly doubled its annual budget (currently $3 million) and its staff (currently 28, with planned expansion to 37). With offices in lower Manhattan and Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with the Department of Correction and Health + Hospitals, and often with other government and external partners, on a wide variety of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities. The Board brings to this work a strong emphasis on data-sharing, data-driven decision making and public reporting. In keeping with major reforms occurring at the national, state and local level, the Board recently re-envisioned its mission: to carry out independent oversight and enact regulation in support of safer, fairer, smaller and more humane jails.'\n",

      " 'The New York City Board of Correction (BOC) is a nine-person, non-judicial oversight board, which regulates, monitors, and inspects the correctional facilities of the City. Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the BoardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s five functions: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tEstablish and ensure compliance with minimum standards for the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tInvestigate serious incidents; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tReview grievances from inmates and staff; Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tEvaluate the performance of the Department of Correction; and, Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\\tMake recommendations on areas of key correctional planning.  The Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules codifying ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. In late 2016, the Board enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jails. Recently, BOC commenced rulemaking on restrictive housing and going forward, will update its Mental Health Minimum Standards.  Over the past two years, to expand its research, monitoring and rule-making efforts, the Board has nearly doubled its annual budget (currently $3 million) and its staff (currently 28, with planned expansion to 38). With offices in lower Manhattan and Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with the Department of Correction and Health + Hospitals, and often with other government and external partners, on a wide variety of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities. The Board brings to this work a strong emphasis on data-sharing, data-driven decision making and public reporting. In keeping with major reforms occurring at the national, state and local level, the Board recently re-envisioned its mission: to carry out independent oversight and enact regulation in support of safer, fairer, smaller and more humane jails.'\n",
